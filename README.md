Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) project - Monitoring and control of Tesla vehicles account Linking example site

This website provides a complete example of packaged account linking capability for the Amazon Echo service 
and the Alexa skills Kit.  This website is ready to deploy to a cloud hosting service such as Microsoft
Azure.  The site uses Express and the [TeslaJS library](https://github.com/mseminatore/TeslaJS) 
to provide a webapp that can authenticate a user with Tesla.com and acquire an OAuth token for Alexa.

The website correctly handles and responds to account linking query request from the Amazon Alexa service.
